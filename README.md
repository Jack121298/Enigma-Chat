Compiled and ran using: Java version 11.0.14 - Amazon Correto

                        **SERVER**
Run Server before running clients. Running clients before server will error after a name has been typed

                        **CLIENT**
Clients may be any amount as each client is handled by threads on the server.

When giving text to program to message and encode, remove any carriage returns as it will run the program prematurely. 
Any text taken from say wikipedia for bulk encryption/decryption will result in some issues as the program will run prematurely and not copy fully

Be aware that any symbol not part of Enigma will be discared except for whitespace. Leaving whitespace was a design decision used to help me present and show that the
messages do get encrypted/decrypted without fail. This would obviously make it very easy to crack Enigma


                      **OTHER*FILES**
Enigma presentation and class diagram can be found in the other files tab
Text file contains a link to my video to FlipGrid showcasing this project

Enjoy!
